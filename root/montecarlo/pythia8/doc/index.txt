<p>
The pythia8 directory is an interface to the C++ version of Pythia 8.1
event generators, written by T.Sjostrand.
<p>
The user is assumed to be familiar with the Pythia8 package. 
Only a basic interface to Pythia8 is provided. Because Pythia8 is
also written in C++, its functions/classes can be called directly from a
compiled C++ script.
To call Pythia functions not available in this interface a dictionary must
be generated. 
<p>
see $ROOTSYS/tutorials/pythia/pythia8.C for an example of use from CINT.
