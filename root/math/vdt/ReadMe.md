The VDT mathematical library
============================

What is VDT?
------------

**VDT is a library of mathematical functions**, implemented in double and single
precision. The implementation is **fast** and with the aid of modern compilers
(e.g. gcc 4.7) vectorisable.
 
VDT exploits also Pade polynomials. A lot of ideas were inspired by the **cephes
math library** (by Stephen L. Moshier, moshier@na-net.ornl.gov) as well as
portions of actual code. The Cephes library can be found here:

 * log
 * exp
 * sincos
 * sin
 * cos
 * tan
 * asin

 * inverse sqrt
 * inverse (faster than division, based on isqrt)
