To install MathMore from SVN (trunk revision) do the following (you need also mathcore), since the built library will contain both: 

   >   svn co  https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/mathcore mathcore
   >   svn co  https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/mathmore mathmore

   >   cd mathmore 

 run the setup script which uses autoconf and automake to generate the makefile. Be sure to have a not too old version of autoconf/automake installed in your system 


   >   build/setup.sh


configure with the configure script. To use MathMore outside ROOT, you need to specify a location of GSL. A tar file of GSL with the functions needed by MathMore is available in the mathmore/src directory. If you don't have a version of GSL in your system you can build  the one distributed with mathmore using configure and make. 


   > ./configure --with-gsl=$gsl_dir 



   > make

   

To build the test do: 

   > make check 

and to run them (like testRootFinder)  do: 

   > test/testRootFinder

If you install from the tar file, you can skip the setup part and run directly configure.
