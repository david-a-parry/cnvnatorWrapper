  \page Vector2DPage  2D Point and Vector Classes


Similar to the \ref Vector3DPage and \ref Point3DPage , typedefs are defined to avoid exposing templated parameter to the users, for all 2D vectors based an double's and float's. To use them, one must include the header file <em>Math/Vector2D.h</em>  or <em>Math/Point2D.h</em>.
The following typedef's, defined in the header file <em>Math/Vector2Dfwd.h</em>, are available for the different instantiations of the template class ROOT::Math::DisplacementVector2D:    

<ul>
<li>ROOT::Math::XYVector  vector based on x,y coordinates (cartesian) in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::XYVectorF  vector based on x,y coordinates (cartesian) in float precision
<li>ROOT::Math::Polar2DVector vector based on r,phi coordinates (polar) in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::Polar2DVectorF vector based on r,phi coordinates (polar) in float precision
</ul>
<p> 
The typedef's, defined in the header file <em>Math/Point2Dfwd.h</em>, available for the different instantiations of the template class ROOT::Math::PoistionVector2D are:    

<ul>
<li>ROOT::Math::XYPoint  vector based on x,y coordinates (cartesian) in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::XYPointF  vector based on x,y coordinates (cartesian) in float precision
<li>ROOT::Math::Polar2DPoint vector based on r,phi coordinates (polar) in double precision
<li>ROOT::Math::Polar2DPointF vector based on r,phi coordinates (polar) in float precision
</ul>
<p> 
Similar constructs, functions and operations available for  the 3D vectors and points (see \ref Vector3DPage and \ref Point3DPage ) are available also for the 2D vector and points.

No transformations or rotation classes are available for the 2D vectors.
