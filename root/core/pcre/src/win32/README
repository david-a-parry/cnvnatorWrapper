Building pcre on Windows
===========================================================

Usage: 
   nmake -f Makefile.msc CFG="libpcre - Win32 Release"
or for the debug version:
   nmake -f Makefile.msc CFG="libpcre - Win32 Debug"

When changing the version of pcre, please change the 
version in these two lines in Makefile.msc:

SRCDIR  = pcre-X.X
LIBRARY = libpcre-X.X
===========================================================

===========================================================
In case of problem, here is a couple of things to check:
===========================================================

In case of an undefined symbol, check in which file the 
missing symbol is. if it is in pcre.h.in, compare the file 
pcre.h in this directory (win32) and pcre.h.in the pcre 
distribution to see if any definition has changed or has 
been added. If it is the case, modify pcre.h and try again

In case of unresolved external symbol, check in which 
source file (from the pcre distribution) the symbol is
and make sure this file is in the list of object files 
in Makefile.msc:
OBJS =   "../$(SRCDIR)/pcre_chartables.obj" \
[...]
         "../$(SRCDIR)/pcreposix.obj"

If the file is missing, just add it in the list with the 
same format than the others
===========================================================
