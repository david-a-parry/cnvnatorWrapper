<h3>CINT</h3>
<p>This version contains no major new features.
CINT7 has seen considerable speed improvements; only bug fixes were incorporated in the other packages.
CINT5 or 7 can now be configured independently; <tt>--enable-cint5 --disable-cint7</tt> is the default.
New web site for <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/interpreter">ROOT's interpreters and dictionaries</a> and <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cint">stand-alone CINT</a> as well as <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/reflex">Reflex</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>CINT5 and CINT7
    <ul>
      <li>Improve the platform independence of paths.</li>
      <li>Fix the lookup of types nested in classes with default template parameters.</li>
      <li><tt>.Lk macro.C</tt> will load the file macro.C only if it is not currently loaded. <tt>.L macro.C</tt> would unload it and all files that have been loaded later, and then reload it. Also implemented <tt>.xk macro.C</tt>.</li>
      <li>Fix for recursive loading (e.g. autoloading) of libraries during dictionary initialization.</li>
      <li>Fix parsing of negative values that are larger than int.</li>
      <li>Create the proper short name for templates with templated default arguments: <tt>a&lt;b&lt;c&gt;,d=e&gt;</tt> was shortened to <tt>a&lt;b&lt;c&gt;&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>a&lt;b&lt;c&gt; &gt;</tt>.</li>
      <li>Add missing <tt>complex&lt;T&gt;</tt> functions (thanks, Daniel Barna!).</li>
      <li>Improve the casting from (free) function pointer to void* in dictionaries using a union.</li>
      <li>Support <tt>_attribute_</tt> in the parser (by ignoring it).</li>
      <li>Do not convert path names to lower case anymore.</li>
      <li>Support const static data members with inline initialization: <tt>class A{static const int i=42;};</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CINT5
    <ul>
      <li>The include files are moved back from <tt>include/cint/</tt> to <tt>include/</tt> for backward compatibility reasons. CINT7's headers remain in <tt>include/cint7</tt>.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CINT7
    <ul>
      <li>Major improvements in the CPU performance of CINT7; it is now much faster (&gt; factor 5 for interpreting stress.cxx)</li>
      <li>Fixes for const correctness of CINT's code, especially for const char*.</li>
      <li>Added support for autoloading typedefs.</li>
      <li>Fix issue with G__struct being initialized too late.</li>
      <li>Properly identify the library that a dictionary belongs to.</li>
      <li>Fix compiler warnings.</li>
      <li>Fix dictionary for <tt>abs()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Reduce memory usage by reimplementing some internal data structures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Reflex</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Full support for ClassDef() macros with the full benefits of faster I/O due to a direct access instead of a search in a map for writing out objects.</li>
      <li>Reimplement <tt>UpdateMembers()</tt> and <tt>PathToBase()</tt> in a backward compatible way.
      The Member getters now support an enum argument (<tt>Reflex::INHERITEDMEMBERS_NO</tt> or <tt>Reflex::INHERITEDMEMBERS_ALSO</tt>) to request only the class's member or also inherited members.
      This allows to ignore possible calls to <tt>UpdateMembers()</tt>.
      The default value for this argument to the member getters is <tt>Reflex::INHERITEDMEMBERS_DEFAULT</tt> which will behave like <tt>Reflex::INHERITEDMEMBERS_NO</tt> until the first call to <tt>UpdateMembers()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Fix visibility of UnionBuilder's symbols (GCC, MSVC)</li>
      <li>Fix for unnamed types in genreflex.</li>
      <li>genreflex got fixed for functions taking arrays or pointers thereof.</li>
      <li>Many and improvements to the test suite, many new tests.</li>
      <li>Further improvements to genreflex support of TObject derived classes / classes implementing the ClassDef macro.</li>
      <li>Complain if a class derives from TObject but does not use ClassDef</li>
      <li>Fix constness and scope of the return type of shadows' final overrider</li>
      <li>FunctionTypeBuilder does not delete existing types anymore.</li>
      <li>For derived types (array, typedef), delay the calculation of SizeOf() until the underlying type is know.</li>
      <li>Added a CMake macro REFLEX_ADD_DICTIONARY for the dictionary creation, to be used by external packages.</li>
      <li>Fix for unsigned long template parameters (<tt>A&lt;unsigned long&gt;</tt> which GCCXML instantiates as e.g. <tt>A&lt;12ul&gt;</tt>); fixes an issue with boost::array.</li>
      <li>Added MSVC8 to genreflex's list of supported compilers, fix build for MSVC7.1.</li>
      <li>Remove stray spaces after <tt>string</tt> in rootmap files.</li>
      <li>Use qualified types for Reflex types instead of <tt>using namespace Reflex</tt>.</li>
      <li>Allow selection of genreflex classes and their members via a typedef-to-class.</li>
      <li>Implement new genreflex option <tt>--gccxmlpost</tt> to postprocess a GCC_XML output file with genreflex, useful for debugging.</li>
      <li>Remove dictionaries for PropertyList methods that had been deprecated for years.</li>
      <li>Suppress dictionaries for unnamed enums.</li>
      <li>Satisfy python 2.6.2 and silence its warnings.</li>
      <li>Rename GCC_XML output file to *_gccxmlout.xml, so it is easier to distinguish it from selection.xml file.</li>
      <li>Improve the initialization and shutdown of Reflex; remove the memory leaks due to the reflection containers not beeing cleared at the end of the process.</li>
      <li>Modified the behavior of Reflex dictionary (namely ClassBuilder).  Rather than unconditionally erasing existing information, a 2nd ClassBuilder will either add new information or check that it is compatible with the existing information (and throwing an exception in case of problems).  To be able to over-ride an existing definition, unload the class before calling ClassBuilder.</li>
      <li>Also create dictionaries for const static data members.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Cintex</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow changes in ROOT's CollectionProxy interface.</li>
      <li>Don't cache Reflex::Member for functions' return types in the stubs; fixes an issue caused by duplicated dictionaries.</li>
      <li>Add dictionary for basic_string&lt;char&gt; for backward compatibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
