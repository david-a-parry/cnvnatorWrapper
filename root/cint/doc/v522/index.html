<h3>CINT</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved initialization of class static variable that are objects until a more comprehensive solution (after the cint7 initial release).</li>
<li>Dictionaries for templated functions are now accessible both as <tt>func&lt;int&gt;(int)</tt> and <tt>func(int)</tt>.</li>
<li>Several small bug fixes, e.g. for template parameters being arrays, functions returning templated classes, allowing CINT to parse <tt>T*const&amp;</tt>.
<li>Support qt cintdll for Qt4.</li>
<li>Improved support for permanent library (in particular for <tt>TSystem::DynFindSymbol</tt>.)</li>
<li>Corrected the handling of function parameter of type 'reference to bool'.</li>
<li>Avoid incorrectly matching a non-static class member function when called without an object 
(i.e. typically <tt>TString::Form(...));</tt>).  Previously this was allowed and lead to a segfault.</li>
<li>port to FreeBSD 7.0.</li>
<li>CINT can now autmatically generate dictionary for templated classes, e.g. A&lt;B&gt; if the header file for A and B is known.
This allows to interpret vector&lt;MyClass&gt; by transparently generating a
dictionary for it. This feature can be toggeled on or off by ".autodict".</li>
<li>Added support for cintdlls using the new default STL implementation of MSVC8, 9 that implement additional runtime asserts.</li>
<li>Extended <pre>#pragma link C++ defined_in filename;</pre>to look for the file name in the same include paths as G__loadfile 
(i.e. previously defined_in was restrict to full path names and relative path names)</li>
<li>Allow quote around the file name for #pragma link defined_in</li>
<li>Added support for recording any typedef in a rootmap file</li>
<li>CINT now also keeps track (see .files) of the libraries that have been loaded indirectly (i.e. via a hard link as opposed to via G__loadfile for example) 
and that contain a CINT dictionary.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reflex</h4>
<ul>
<li>GCCXML 0.9 is now fully supported.</li>
<li>GCCXML 0.6 is no longer supported.</li>
<li>genreflex can now generate dictionaries for classes deriving (directly or indirectly) from TObject or any other class using the <tt>ClassDef(<i>classname</i>, <i>version</i>)</tt> macro.</li>
<li><tt>Member::Invoke()</tt> and <tt>Object::Invoke()</tt> now expect the return value's buffer as an argument. This fixes memory leaks caused by the Reflex function wrappers and invalidation of results.</li>
<li>Search path for GCCXML is now --gccxmlpath= specified to genreflex, ROOT configured with --with-gccxml, gccxml in $PATH; then abort</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cintex</h4>
<ul>
<li>Support SELinux (e.g. on SLC5).</li>
</ul>
