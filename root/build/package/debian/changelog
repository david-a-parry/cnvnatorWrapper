    - libraries in /usr/lib - and libQt is a plug-in and should not be linked
   to directly by developer. (Closes: #525142)
  * Fix "include Math/ProbFuncMathCore.h fails with CINT" Removed relative

  * Added some lintian overrides.
  * Moved some shared configuration files to root-common.
  * Fixed problems in init scripts.
  * Fixed problem with wrappers using `root-config'.
  * Removed some unused configuation scripts.

  * Removed /usr/share/root/proof/etc/*.sample and install them as
    examples instead.
  * Made `Replaces' and `Conflicts' dependencies on older packages
    be version specific to static version numbers.  We don't want
    libroot-roofit to conflict with root-plugin-rootfit for all time.

  * [Kevin] Fixed a problem with libXrdProof.so symlinks in root-xrootd.
  * [Kevin] Made a wrapper script that calls proofserv with LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    set to the plugin directory.   This should be fixed upstream.
  * [Kevin] Made wrapper scripts that calls xrdpwdadmin and xrdgsiproxy with
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to plugin-script.
  * [Kevin] Fixed problem in man page of xrdcp.

  * Fixed a problem in the rules file with a errornous backslash.
  * Make configure output config.log for debugging.
  * [Kevin] Build depend on libmysqlclient15-dev instead of older 12 or 14.
  * [Kevin] Fix typo's in description of libroot-minuit.
  * [Kevin] Use `-s' instead of `-a'.
  * [Kevin] Fix a logic error in ttf-root-installer.
  * [Kevin] Moved dependency of fonts from libroot to root-common.
  * [Kevin] Removed all mention of root-cint
  * [Kevin] Fixed problem with `set -e' in root-rootd.postrm.
  * [Kevin] Set sticky bit on `/var/cache/rootd/{tmp,pub}' so users can
    not overwrite each others files (root-rootd.preinst).
  * Make sure that libHbook is linked against libg2c.so and not libg2c.a
    which made `lintian' complain about `shlib-with-non-pic-code'.

  * Fixed some build-dependencies.  In partiucular, libsqlod75-dev is only
    available on certain platforms, and libpacklib1-dev is not available on
    GNU/kFreeBSD.

root (5.09.01-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed some build dependencies.
  * Fixed some non-POSIX /bin/sh code
  * Fixed Python module location
  * Added libafterimage-dev build-dependencies - eventually we'll use the
    normal libafterimage-dev, but currently that's disabled up-stream.
  * Added the executable xproofd to the root-proofd package, along with
    it's man(1) page.
  * Removed build-depends on libxpm4-dev, as that pulls in libxaw7-dev,
    which is not really what we need.  Instead the build-depends is now
    libxpm.
  * The TTF installer package now depends on msttcorefonts, and makes
    mostly symbolic links to files in that package.  Hence, we only need
    to get and install `symbol.ttf' and `windings.ttf'.
  * Revived the package root-plugin-sapdb as root-plugin-maxdb.  Thanks to
    Ricardo Yanez for pointing out libsqlod to me.

root (5.09.01-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the package root-common to hold common files
  * Replaced root-plugin-clarens, root-plugin-ldap, root-plugin-mlp
    root-plugin-python, root-plugin-quadp, root-plugin-roofit,
    root-plugin-ruby with two packages, a run-time library package
    (libroot-<...><version>) and a development package (libroot-<...>-dev).
    This is because developers may want to link against these libraries.
  * Removed the package root-cint, and moved libraries to libroot, headers
    and the like to libroot-dev, and programs to root-bin.  The
    alternatives still exists for cint and makecint.
  * Applied a patch that allows ROOT to use DFSG free TTF's rather than
    the MS Core Fonts.
  * Put a symlink to ruby extension library in ruby load directory.
    These are in the _development_ package.
  * Put a symlink to Python script and extension library in Python
    load directory. These are in the _development_ package.
  * Fixed some dependency issues, and similar - thanks to Kevin McCarty
    for all his help on this.

root (5.04.00-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some new stuff to handle the libraries and plugins installed by the
    packages.   For the plugin packages, we do not install the link
    libraries in /usr/lib/root, but in /usr/lib/root/<version>, as these
    libraries are really plugins and should not be linked against.
    However, we do need to install the `lib<Name>.so.<version>' in
    /usr/lib/root, as some may incrementally link against these.
