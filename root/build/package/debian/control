Description: metapackage to install all ROOT packages
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data
 efficiently.
 .
 With the data defined as a set of objects, specialized storage methods
 can give direct access to the separate attributes of the selected
 objects, without having to touch the bulk of the data. Included are
 histogramming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function
 evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the
 easy creation of an analysis system that can query and process the data
 interactively or in batch mode.
 .
 The command language, the scripting (or macro) language, and the   
 programming language are all C++, thanks to the built-in CINT C++    
 interpreter. This interpreter removes the time consuming compile/link
 cycle, allowing for fast prototyping of the macros, and providing a
 good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the
 interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.
 .
 The system has been designed in such a way that it can query its
 databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations
 or high-end PCs. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically
 extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier
 platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data
 analysis systems.
 .
 This package is a metapackage to ensure the installation of all
 possible ROOT packages on a system.

 random variate generation. The sample program can then generate

Description: Splot library for ROOT
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the

 A common method used in High Energy Physics to perform measurements
 is the maximum Likelihood method, exploiting discriminating variables
 to disentangle signal from background. The crucial point for such an
 analysis to be reliable is to use an exhaustive list of sources of
 events combined with an accurate description of all the Probability
 Density Functions (PDF).  
 .
 To assess the validity of the fit, a convincing quality check is to
 explore further the data sample by examining the distributions of
 control variables. A control variable can be obtained for instance by
 removing one of the discriminating variables before performing again
 the maximum Likelihood fit: this removed variable is a control
 variable. The expected distribution of this control variable, for
 signal, is to be compared to the one extracted, for signal, from the
 data sample. In order to be able to do so, one must be able to unfold
 from the distribution of the whole data sample.
 .
 The SPlot method allows to reconstruct the distributions for the
 control variable, independently for each of the various sources of
 events, without making use of any a priori knowledge on this
 variable. The aim is thus to use the knowledge available for the
 discriminating variables to infer the behaviour of the individual
 sources of events with respect to the control variable.
 .
 SPlot is optimal if the control variable is uncorrelated with the
 discriminating variables.

Description: Numerical data analysis framework - general applications
 The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
 functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data
 efficiently. 
 .
 With the data defined as a set of objects, specialized storage methods
 can give direct access to the separate attributes of the selected
 objects, without having to touch the bulk of the data. Included are
 histogramming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function
 evaluation, minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the
 easy creation of an analysis system that can query and process the data
 interactively or in batch mode.
 .
 The command language, the scripting (or macro) language, and the   
 programming language are all C++, thanks to the built-in CINT C++    
 interpreter. This interpreter removes the time consuming compile/link
 cycle, allowing for fast prototyping of the macros, and providing a
 good environment to learn C++. If more performance is needed, the
 interactively developed macros can be compiled using a C++ compiler.
 .
 The system has been designed in such a way that it can query its
 databases in parallel on MPP machines or on clusters of workstations
 or high-end PCs. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically
 extended by linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier
 platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data
 analysis systems.
