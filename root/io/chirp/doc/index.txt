This directory contains the I/O interface classes for the <b>Chirp</b> filesystem.  Briefly, Chirp is a lightweight user-level distributed filesystem designed for sharing code and data across wide area computing grids.  It provides extensive support for multiple authentication methods, allowing you to mix users employing Globus, Kerberos, hostname, and ticket authentication.  Ordinary POSIX applications can be transparently attached to a Chirp filesystem using either Parrot or FUSE.
<p>
To build ROOT with Chirp support, you must have the Notre Dame CCTools package version 3.2.2 or greater installed.
