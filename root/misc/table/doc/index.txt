This directory contains the generic C++ class library contributed by STAR collaboration 
(http://www.star.bnl.gov). 
BEGIN_HTML
The library is to create the light and effective hierarchical organized environment 
the kind the STAR offline framework was built with. 
<br>
The classes are generic and are not STAR specific.
The base class class  of this library is TDataSet:
<pre>
   TDataSet object ::= the "named" list of TDataSet objects
</pre> 
That defines the hierarchical nature the class and all its subclasses.
<br>
The most advanced subclasses of TDataSet are TTable and TGenericTable 
to create the TDataSet implementations bearing the self-described variable length arrays 
of the C-structures.
