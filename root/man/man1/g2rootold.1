.SH NAME
g2rootold \- convert GEANT geomtry files to ROOT files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g2rootoldd 
.I [-f map_name] geant_name macro_name
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
You can convert a 
.B GEANT 
(see 
.I http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/asd/geant/index.html 
fore more on 
.BR GEANT )
geometry to 
.B ROOT 
geometry with the following steps
.TP 
1 
Run the interactive version of 
.B GEANT 
and produce a Zebra RZ file 
.IR detector.geom , 
by typing the command:
.sp 1 
.RS
Geant > rz/file 21 \fIdetector.geom\fR on
.RE
.sp 1
.TP
2 
Run the 
.B g2rootold 
program to convert the Zebra RZ file into a 
.B ROOT 
macro 
.I detector.C:
.sp 1 
.RS
g2rootold \fIdetector.geom\fR \fIdetector.C\fR
.RE
.sp 1
.TP 
3
Run the following 
.B ROOT 
session;
.sp 1 
.RS
.nf
root [1] .x detector.C
root [2] detector.Draw()
root [3] c1.x3d()   // (this invokes the 3-d Root viewver)
root [4] TFile f("detector.root","NEW") //open a new root file
root [5] detector.Write() //Write the geometry structure
root [6] f.Write() 
.fi
.RE
.sp 1
Note that the 
.I TNode 
structure currently in 
.B ROOT 
was not designed as a replacement for a true geometry package. The
idea was mainly to draw simple geometries in event display
programs. We are currently investigating several alternatives for a
true & efficient geometry package supporting;
.TP
- 
a disk data base with storage of multiple geometry versions
.TP 
- 
an interactive editor and viewer
.TP
- 
with 3-d views
.TP
- 
but also 2-d cut views
.TP 
- 
with interfaces to existing or future MC such as 
.B GEANT3 
or 
.B GEANT4
.PP
A second program called 
.B gh2root
(see 
.IR http://root.cern.ch/root/gh2root.html )
generates automatically C++ code corresponding to the 
.B GEANT3 Zebra 
structures 
.IR JSET , 
.IR JVERTX , 
.IR JKINE , 
.I JHITS  
and 
.I JDIGI.

.\" $Log: g2rootold.1,v $
.\" Revision 1.1  2005/03/21 21:42:21  rdm
.\" From Christian Holm Christensen:
.\"       * New Debian and RedHat rpm packaging scripts.
.\"       * Added a description to `build/package/debian/README.Debian' on
.\"         how to add a new package.   It's not that complicated so it
.\"         should be a simple thing to add a new package, even for some
.\"         with little or no experience with RPMs or DEBs.
.\"       * When searching for the Oracle client libraries, I added the
.\"         directories `/usr/lib/oracle/*/client/lib' and
.\"         `/usr/include/oracle/*/client' - as these are the paths that the
.\"         RPMs install into.
.\"       * I added the packages `root-plugin-krb5' and
.\"         `root-plugin-oracle'.
.\"       * The library `libXMLIO' is in `libroot'.
.\"       * The package `root-plugin-xml' contains the XML parser.
.\"       * I fixed an cosmetic error in `build/misc/root.m4'.  The
.\"         definition of `ROOT_PATH' should be quoted, otherwise aclocal
.\"         will complain.
.\"       * In the top-level `Makefile' I pass an additional argument to
.\"         `makecintdlls' - namely `$(ROOTCINTTMP)'.  In `makecintdlls' I
.\"         use that argument to make the various dictionaries for
.\"         `lib...Dict.so'.   Originally, the script used plain `rootcint'.
.\"         However, as `rootcint' may not be in the path yet, or the one in
.\"         the path may be old, this failed.  Hence, I use what we know is
.\"         there - namely the newly build `rootcint_tmp'.  BTW, what are
.\"         these shared libraries, and where do they belong?  I guess they
.\"         are specific to ROOT, and not used by plain `CINT'.  For now, I
.\"         put them in `libroot'.
.\"       *  Made the two `virtual' packages `root-db-client' - provided the
.\"         DB plugins, and `root-fitter' provided by `root-plugin-minuit'
.\"         and `root-plugin-fumili'.  Note, the virtual package
.\"         `root-file-server' provided by `root-rootd' and `root-xrootd'
.\"         already existed in the previous patch.
.\"       * Note, I added the directory `build/package/debian/po' which is
.\"         for translations of DebConf templates.  DebConf is Debians very
.\"         advanced package configuration interface.   It presents the user
.\"         with a set of questions in some sort of `GUI' based on how much
.\"         the user would like to change.  These `dialogs' can be
.\"         translated quite easily.  As an example, I translated the
.\"         questions used by the `ttf-root-installer' package into Danish.
.\"         I'm sure someone can translate them into German, French,
.\"         Italien, Spanish, and so on.
.\"
.\" Revision 1.1  2001/08/15 13:30:48  rdm
.\" move man files to new subdir man1. This makes it possible to add
.\" $ROOTSYS/man to MANPATH and have "man root" work.
.\"
.\" Revision 1.1  2000/12/08 17:41:00  rdm
.\" man pages of all ROOT executables provided by Christian Holm.
