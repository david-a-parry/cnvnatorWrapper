.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pq2-ls
[options] [datasets]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR pq2-ls
program.
.PP
.B pq2-ls
is a script invoking the
.B pq2
ROOT application to list the available datasets in a dataset meta-repository based on ROOT files;
the repository can be accessed via the local file
system or a remote file server daemon or a PROOF facility.
.PP
More details about the underlying 'pq2' application can be found in the man page \fIpq2\fR(1).
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP

\fB-v\fR
Verbose mode
.TP 
\fB--forcescan\fR
Force opening of the datasets are open to get the information; by default the pre-processed information is used, if any.
.TP 
\fB--noupdate\fR
In the case a cache is used, do not update the cache (may be slow on some servers).
.TP 
\fB--refresh\fR

.TP
\fB-d\fR <\fIdataset\fR>, \fB--dataset\fR=<\fIdataset\fR>
Alternative way to define the dataset or the datasets to be listed.
.TP
\fB-u\fR <\fIserverurl\fR>, \fB--url\fR=<\fIserverurl\fR>
URL of the PROOF master or data server providing the information; for data servers, it must include the directory.
Can also be specified via the environment variables PQ2PROOFURL or PQ2DSSRVURL (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES)."
.TP
\fB-t\fR <\fIdir\fR>, \fB--tmpdir\fR=<\fIdir\fR>
Directory for temporary files; defualt is /tmp/<username>.
.SH "FORMAT OF THE OUTPUT"
The information printed by pq2-ls has the following format:
.nf

/group/user/dsname                        | # files |  /<def-tree> | # evts   | size     | staged fraction

.fi
for example
.nf

Dataset URI                               | # Files | Default tree | # Events |   Disk   | Staged
/PWG2/akisiel/Therminator_c2030           |     952 | /esdTree     |      927 |     4 GB |   97 %

.fi

The space reserved for the default tree name is 14 characters: for longer names the last character is substituded
with a '>'.
