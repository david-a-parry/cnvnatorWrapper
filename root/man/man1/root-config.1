.SH SYNOPSIS
.B root-config
.I "[options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Put lines like 
.RS 
.nf 

CFLAGS = $(shell root-config \-\-cflags)

You may also find the \fIautomake\fR(1), \fIautoconf\fR(1), and
\fIlibtool\fR(1) macro file \fI/usr/share/aclocal/root.m4\fR
useful.  If that macro file isn't installed where \dIaclocal\fR will
find it, copy the contents to your local \fIacinclude.m4\fR file.  In
the directories you use \fBROOT\fR libraries, have in your
\fIMakefile.am\fR file: 
.RS 
.nf 

lib_LTLIBRARIES         = libFoo.la
pkginclude_HEADERS      = Foo.h
noinst_HEADERS          = FooCint.h
libFoo_la_SOURCES       = Foo.cxx FooCint.cxx   
libFoo_la_LDFLAGS       = \-version-info 1:0 \-R @ROOTLIBDIR@
libFoo_la_LDADD         = \-lCore \-lCint @ROOTAUXLIBS@

BUILT_SOURCES           = FooCint.cxx FooCint.h 

AM_CPPFLAGS             = \-I@ROOTINCDIR@
AM_LDFLAGS              = \-L@ROOTLIBDIR@

where you should substitute \fBFoo\fR with whatever, and list the
appropriate source files in the \fB_SOURCES\fR variable. In you
\ficonfigure.in\fR file, put:
.RS
.nf

AC_PROG_CC
AC_PROG_CXX
ROOT_PATH
AM_PROG_LIBTOOL

.fi
.RE
along with any other macros you may need. 
.PP
Note that the \fBROOT_PATH\fR macro takes three optional arguments:
the minimal \fBROOT\fR version to use, action if \fBROOT\fR is found,
and action if \fBROOT\fR isn't found.  Some examples are 
.RS
.nf

ROOT_PATH(3.03/05, , AC_MSG_ERROR(Your ROOT version is too old))
ROOT_PATH(, AC_DEFUN(HAVE_ROOT))

.fi
.RE
For example, if you want to compile some part of your source tree
conditionally on wether \fBROOT\fR is present or not, you can put in
your \fIconfigure.in\fR file 
.RS
.nf

ROOT_PATH(,
[
  AC_DEFUN(HAVE_ROOT)
  have_root=yes  
])
AM_CONDITIONAL(GOT_ROOT, test "x$have_root" = "xyes")

.fi
.RE
And then in some \fIMakefile.am\fR
.RS
.nf

EXTRA_SOURCES		= root_depenent_source.cc
if GOT_ROOT
LIBFOOXTRA              = root_depenent_source.cc
else
LIBFOOXTRA              =
endif

lib_LTLIBRARIES         = libFoo.la
libFoo_la_SOURCES	= Foo.cc  $(LIBFOOXTRA)

full path to \fIrootcint\fR
.TP

.TP
.B ROOTINCDIR

.TP
.B ROOTCFLAGS
Extra compiler flags
.TP
.B ROOTLIBS
\fBROOT\fR basic libraries 
.TP
.B ROOTGLIBS
\fBROOT\fR basic + GUI libraries
.TP
.B ROOTAUXLIBS

.TP
.B ROOTAUXCFLAGS

.TP
.B ROOTRPATH
Same as \fBROOTLIBDIR\fR
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP 
.B \-\-help
Gives a short list of options available, and exit
.TP
.B \-\-version 
Report the version number of installed \fBROOT\fR, and exit. 
.TP
.BI \-\-prefix =<prefix>
If no arguments is given, reports where \fBROOT\fR is installed. With
an argument of =\fI<prefix>\fR, set the base of the subsequent options
to \fI<prefix>\fR. If \fB\\-\-exec-prefix\fR is passedwith an argument,
that argument overrides the argument given to \fB\\-\-prefix\fR for the
library path. 
.TP
.BI \-\-exec-prefix =<prefix>
If no argument is given, report where the libraries are installed. If
an argument is given, use that as the installation base directory for
the libraries. This option does not affect the include path. 
.TP
.B \-\-libdir
Print the directory where the ROOT libraries are installed. 
.TP
.B \-\-incdir
Print the directory where the ROOT headers are installed. 
.TP
.B \-\-libs
Output a line suitable for linking a program agains the \fBROOT\fR
libraries. No graphics libraries are output. 
.TP
.B \-\-glibs
As above, but also output for the graphics libraries. 
.TP
.B \-\-cflags
Output a line suitable for compiling a source file againd the
\fBROOT\fR header (class declararion) files. 
.TP
.B \-\-new 
Put the \fBlibNew.so\fR library in the library lists.  This option
\fImust\fR be given before options \fB\-\-libs\fR and \fB\-\-glibs\fR. 
.TP
.B \-\-nonew 
Compatiblity option. Does nothing. 
.TP
.B \-\-auxlibs
Print auxiliary libraries and/or system linker flags.
.TP
.B \-\-noauxlibs
Do not print auxiliary libraries and/or system linker flags in the
output of \fB\-\-libs\fR and \fB\-\-glibs\fR. 
.B \-\-auxcflags
Print auxiliary compiler flags.
.TP
.B \-\-noauxcflags
Do not print auxiliary compiler flags in the output of
\fB\-\-cflags\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-noldflags
Do not print library path link option in output of \fB\-\-libs\fR and
\fB\-\-glibs\fR.
